Each grid has prefixes assigned for server and debugging port numbers as shown below. The servers begin with the port suffix 01 in each in each grid. For example, mygrid is configured to start two servers with server port numbers 20001 and 20002. The debugging port numbers are 10001 and 10002. Note that mygrid and grid0 are assigned the same prefixes and therefore they must not run on the same machine. mygrid is configured to run as a stand-alone grid without child grids. grid0 is configured to run as a parent grid to grid1-grid5.
