@echo off

::
:: You may change this file to assign environment variables. At a minimum,
:: you must set the "REQUIRED" environment variables. The "OPTIONAL" 
:: environment variables are mostly for building Pado and running GemFire
:: tools. All third-party dependencies are specifed in this file. 
::

::
:: IMPORTANT: The following environment variables are set by this file.
:: They are used by Pado internals and scripts. Do not set them manually.
::
::  %PADO_HOME% - The absolute path of the Pado directory. Same as %BASE_DIR%.
::  %BASE_DIR% - The absolute path of the Pado directory. Same as %PADO_HOME%.
::

::
:: REQUIRED: The following environment varirables are required to run Pado.
::
::  %JAVA_HOME% - Java home directory path.
::  %GEMFIRE% - GemFire home path.
::

::
:: Application specifics:
::    %APP_PROPERTIES% - Application specific system properties and JVM settings
::             should be set using APP_PROPERTIES. See the APP_PROPERTIES section
::             below for setting system properties. Note that APP_PROPERTIES
::             overrides Pado settings set by start_server.bat.
::    %APP_JARS% - This environment variable is automatically set to include all
::             jar files in the %BASE_DIR%/lib directory and its 
::             subdirectories. If you want to include other jar files or 
::             class directories then include them in APP_JARS. You might need 
::             to reorder the files listed in APP_JARS if you have multiple versions
::             of classes. If so, prepend the proper jar files. APP_JARS is 
::             found below.
::   %USER_CLASSPATH% - Instead of using APP_JARS which also include Pado jars, 
::            you can set your library class paths using this environment
::            variable. Note that USER_CLASSPATH is placed in front of CLASSPATH.
::            You can change the order where USER_CLASSPATH is included in this
::            file.
::

::
:: OPTIONAL: The following environment varaialbes are optional.
::
::  %ANT_HOME% - The absolute path of the Apache ant root directory. Ant
::              is required to build Pado.
::
:: Note that the class path constructed by this script is used by all executables,
:: i.e., cacheserver, gfmon, databrower, vsd, and gfsh.
